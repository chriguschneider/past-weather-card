# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. The most welcome kinds of PRs are
**translations**, **bug fixes**, and **screenshots / docs polish**. New
features are also welcome — please open an issue first to discuss scope.

If your PR touches code beyond a single locale or a one-line fix, skim
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) first — it covers the data flow, the
forecast-array shape that every consumer relies on, and the chart-plugin
contract. About 10 minutes of reading saves an hour of reverse-engineering.

## Adding a new language

The visual editor and the in-card condition labels are translated via
[`src/locale.js`](src/locale.js). Each language has an entry that contains
two relevant blocks:

- **Top-level keys** — condition names (`sunny`, `rainy`, …), unit labels,
  cardinal directions. These already exist for ~22 languages.
- **`editor: { … }` block** — labels shown inside the visual editor
  (sensor picker labels, section headings, units page). Currently only `en`
  (canonical) and `de` ship with this block; all others fall back to English
  at runtime via `tEditor()` in `weather-station-card-editor.js`.

To add or complete a language:

1. Open `src/locale.js`.
2. Find the entry for your language code (e.g. `fr`, `es`, `it`, `ja`).
   If the language doesn't exist yet, add a new entry following the shape
   of the `en` entry.
3. Copy the **entire `editor: { … }` block** from the `en` entry.
4. Translate the values (do not touch the keys).
5. Run `npm install` once if you haven't, then `npm run build`. The bundle is
   regenerated at `dist/weather-station-card.js` — commit it together with
   your locale change.
6. Open a PR. Mention which language you added or extended.

The fallback chain at runtime is: requested language → English → key name.
A missing translation never crashes the card; it just falls through.

## Build & dev workflow

```bash
npm install
npm run lint         # ESLint 10 (typescript-eslint + lit + sonarjs)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run test         # vitest run (see TESTING.md)
npm run coverage     # vitest with v8 coverage provider
npm run depcheck     # dependency-cruiser architecture rules
npm run rollup       # one-shot bundle
npm run build        # lint + typecheck + test + rollup
npm start            # rollup --watch + dev server
```

Built artefact: `dist/weather-station-card.js`. **Always commit the rebuilt
bundle alongside source changes** — HACS serves it directly from the tag.

## CI & branch protection

`master` is protected. Direct pushes are blocked — every change goes
through a pull request. Two CI checks must be green before the merge
button activates:

- **`build`** (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) — lint, audit, typecheck,
  unit tests, coverage gate, depcheck, bundle, e2e + visual regression,
  bundle-budget, and dist-in-sync verification.
- **`Analyze (javascript-typescript)`** (CodeQL) — security analysis.

SonarCloud and Dependabot run on PRs too but are advisory; CodeQL's
`Analyze` job is required, the standalone CodeQL helper check is not.

Linear history is enforced (no merge commits) — the maintainer uses
`gh pr merge --rebase` to land PRs.

## Tests

Pure-function unit tests live under `tests/` and run via Vitest. See
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the conventions on what is in scope (data
layer, classifier, formatting helpers, editor partial smoketests) and
what is intentionally not covered (Lit lifecycle, Chart.js drawing,
full editor DOM). New PRs that touch `src/condition-classifier.ts`,
`src/data-source.ts`, or `src/format-utils.ts` should extend the
corresponding test file.

PRs that change an editor render partial (`src/editor/render-*.ts`)
should extend the matching `tests/editor-render-*.test.js` smoketest:
add cases for any new toggle, sub-section heading, or
`hasSensor` / `hasLiveValue` gating. The smoketests render with mock
`EditorLike` + `EditorContext` so they're cheap to extend — see the
existing files for the pattern.

For UI changes that need eyeballing against a real Home Assistant
instance, see [LOCAL-TESTING.md](LOCAL-TESTING.md) for a Docker-based
recipe that doesn't depend on any maintainer-specific setup.

PRs that introduce a new architectural pattern, shift a public-API
contract, or make a hard-to-reverse choice should land an ADR under
`docs/adr/` alongside the code (see `docs/adr/README.md` for the
criteria and template).

## Code style

- Two-space indent, LF line endings.
- ES2022 features are fine (`?.`, `??`, top-level await is not used).
- Inline comments only when the *why* is non-obvious. Don't restate code.

## Release flow

For maintainers cutting a new `vX.Y.Z` release. The build workflow on
`master` enforces some of these (tag-vs-package.json, CHANGELOG entry
present, dist in sync); the rest are convention.

1. **Bump version** in `package.json`.
2. **CHANGELOG entry** — prepend a `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` block
   (format: see [docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md](docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md#changelog-format)).
   The build workflow extracts this verbatim into the GitHub release
   body when you push the tag, and HACS shows that body in its in-app
   update dialog. **Write for that reader, not for engineers**: plain
   user-perspective English, lead with the user impact, keep
   build/tooling detail in a short "Under the hood" section. If a
   release has no user-facing changes, say so plainly in one sentence
   and stop — don't pad with internal jargon.
3. **Verify these docs reflect what changed** — a release is a good
   time to catch doc drift. None of these are mandatory per release,
   but ask yourself for each:
   - `README.md` — new user-facing config keys, behaviour, screenshots
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — module boundaries, build pipeline, data flow
   - `TESTING.md` — test layers, coverage scope
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev workflow changes
   - `MIGRATION.md` — breaking change for users
4. **`npm run build`** — regenerates `dist/weather-station-card.js`.
   Commit it together with the source. CI will reject the tag push
   if `dist/` is out of sync with HEAD.
5. **Open a PR**, wait for CI green, rebase-merge to `master`.
   `master` is branch-protected — direct push will fail.
6. **Tag and push**:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z master
   git push origin refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
   ```
   The `build` workflow then verifies tag matches `package.json.version`,
   extracts the `[X.Y.Z]` block from `CHANGELOG.md` as release notes,
   and uploads `dist/weather-station-card.js` to the GitHub release —
   HACS picks it up automatically.
