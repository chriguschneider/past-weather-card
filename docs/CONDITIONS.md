# Conditions

How the card derives the weather condition (sun / cloudy / rain / fog / windy / …) from your sensor values, both for the daily chart columns and the live "now" panel.

→ Back to [README](../README.md)

## Current ("now") condition

When `show_main: true`, the main panel's icon and condition text reflect a
**live** classification of the current sensor states (re-evaluated whenever
any sensor updates). The same classifier is used as for the daily forecast
columns, fed with instantaneous values and an instantaneous clear-sky
reference (zenith from latitude + longitude + current UTC time).

Day/night-aware icons are still automatic: when `sun.sun` is below the
horizon, `sunny` and `partlycloudy` swap to their night variants
(`clear-night`, `partlycloudy-night`).

### Precipitation in the live condition needs a *rate* unit

Turning a cumulative precipitation counter into an instantaneous rainfall
rate requires extra history that the live condition classifier does
not consult. (Since v1.12.0 the attribute-row precip cell *does* keep
its own buffer to derive a `mm/h` rate from a cumulative counter — see
[SENSORS.md → Live precipitation rate from a cumulative sensor](SENSORS.md#live-precipitation-rate-from-a-cumulative-sensor)
— but that buffer is not currently wired into the main weather-icon
classifier.) Therefore **precipitation only contributes to the live
"now" condition when the sensor's `unit_of_measurement` ends in `/h`,
`/hr`, or `/hour`**:

| Sensor `unit_of_measurement`                      | Used for live rain? |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `mm/h`, `mm/hr`, `mm/hour`, `in/h`                | ✅ yes               |
| `mm`, `in` (cumulative counter or daily total)    | ❌ falls through to cloud / wind / fog |
| _missing_                                         | ❌ falls through |

The **daily chart** has no such restriction — it derives daily totals via
the recorder's statistics regardless of unit (see [SENSORS.md → Setting up a precipitation sensor](SENSORS.md#setting-up-a-precipitation-sensor)),
and the worst-of-day classification uses those totals directly.

If you only have a cumulative counter, the live "now" icon will not show
rain even while it is raining; the daily chart still reports the day's
total correctly. To get a true live rain icon, expose a `mm/h` rate sensor
(many integrations provide one alongside the counter — e.g. Pirateweather's
`*_precipitation_rate`, Ecowitt's `*_rain_rate`, ESPHome
`pulse_meter`-derived rate templates).

## How conditions are determined

Every day's icon — and the live "now" icon — is derived from the relevant
sensor values by a deterministic classifier (`src/condition-classifier.ts`).
It evaluates rules in priority order (worst-of-day): once a rule matches,
no later rules are checked. Conditions `lightning`, `lightning-rainy`, and
`hail` are **never emitted** — reliable detection requires dedicated
hardware (AS3935 lightning detector, hail-pad / impact sensor) that a
typical weather station does not provide.

`cloud_ratio` is `lux_max / clearsky_lux`, where `clearsky_lux ≈ 110 000 lx
× cos(zenith)` (IES Lighting Handbook §3 for the sea-level clear-sky
maximum; Cooper 1969 declination + standard solar-noon / hour-angle
geometry). Latitude / longitude come from `hass.config.*` automatically.

## Customising thresholds

Every threshold above can be overridden via `condition_mapping.*` keys in your card config. See [CONFIGURATION.md → `condition_mapping`](CONFIGURATION.md#condition_mapping--override-classifier-thresholds) for the full key list and examples.
