// Safety-net cover for the doubled-today framing — the same-calendar-day
// gate must fire whenever the station's last and the forecast's first
// entry represent different local days.
//
// Original repro context: at 00:16 on FRI 2026-05-15 the THU label
// vanished and FRI's label sat between THU and FRI. Root cause was a
// station-side filter (`dropEmptyStationToday`) that dropped the empty
// trailing today-bucket, making the boundary asymmetric. That filter
// is gone now, so the chart's own data path no longer triggers this
// case — but HA integrations can still serve asymmetric data (e.g. a
// weather entity whose forecast hangs a day behind the station). The
// `boundaryIsSameDay` gate keeps the rendering correct in that edge
// case.
